This post summarises the process of creating a GitHub Pages blog by combining ChatGPT and an Agent. It explains how the author consulted ChatGPT about setting up a blog and used the Agent feature to automatically build and configure the site.

## Background (2025-07-21)

There were various ways to create a blog, but after consulting with ChatGPT, the direction became clear. Because GitHub supports an Agent function that can automate tasks, the author decided to create the blog automatically through the Agent.

## Summary of tasks and results

The Agent executed the tasks requested through ChatGPT and returned the results. The article summarises the key requests and outcomes, such as connecting a custom domain, enabling a blog on GitHub, and verifying results.
