In this post we applied a new Minimal Mistakes layout to the autoâ€‘generated blog and compared the features of several AI tools (ChatGPT, Agents, Codex, and GitHub Copilot).
We summarised the tasks needed to switch themes, adjust menus and layout, verify results, and request revisions through the Agent.
Finally we analysed the outcomes and discussed the strengths and limitations of each AI tool when building and maintaining the blog.
