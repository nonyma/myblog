This article explains how to connect a custom domain on GitHub Pages and structure your blog for multiple languages. We design the site using `/ko` and `/en` prefixes or `.ko.md`/`.en.md` file names so that content for each language is automatically generated. We also add the `jekyll‑seo‑tag` and `jekyll‑sitemap` plugins to improve search engine optimization and describe how to automate post creation and translation using the ChatGPT API.

## Designing a Multilingual Structure

- Create files like `_posts/2025-07-30-post-5.ko.md` and `2025-07-30-post-5.en.md` to publish Korean and English versions of each post.
- Define language‑specific menus and post lists by creating `_data/navigation_ko.yml` and `_data/navigation_en.yml`.

## SEO Optimization

- Add the `jekyll-seo-tag` and `jekyll-sitemap` plugins to `_config.yml`.
- Include `title`, `description`, `lang`, `permalink`, and `og_image` in every post’s front matter so search engines and social networks can index and preview the content correctly.
- Provide a `/robots.txt` file and automatically generated `/sitemap.xml` to let crawlers explore the site.

## Automation Workflow

- Design a workflow so that when an agent writes a `.ko.md` post, a corresponding `.en.md` post is automatically generated.
- Use the ChatGPT API to include core keywords and natural expressions in the translations for higher quality.
- Automatically update navigation and configuration files for each language.

Through these steps, the blog at www.nonyma.art will serve both Korean and English versions correctly under your custom domain and have a search‑optimized structure.
