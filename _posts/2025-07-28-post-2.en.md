This post outlines how to automatically organize and apply image files used in blog articles. After the first post, the author realized that managing images would consume the most time, so they designed a structure to select and upload images automatically and insert them into posts.

## Background (2025-07-28)

Image management would be the most inefficient part of the workflow. To streamline the process, they devised a system to choose suitable images, name files, upload them, and insert them in Markdown.

## Automation flow summary

A flowchart shows capturing images, uploading to a GitHub repository, and then applying the images to posts. The author describes using ChatGPT to select necessary images from a temporary folder and to crop or resize them automatically. Using GitHub Actions and an `_tmp-review` directory, the system reviews and adds images to the post along with additional metadata.
